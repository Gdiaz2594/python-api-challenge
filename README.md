#### WeatherPy Analysis
Accordding to the plots and all the data found I can conclude that:
* When closer to the Ecuator the temperature is gratter and as you get further from the Ecuator it gets colder.
* When further from the Ecuator in the norther hemisphere the humidity increases, but in the southern hemisphere the humidity is very diverse no matter the latitude. 
* When further from the Ecuator the wind speed tens to be bigger in both hemispheres.
